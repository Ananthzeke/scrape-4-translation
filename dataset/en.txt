Malnutrition is one of the most important challenges facing contemporary India. Nutrition is acknowledged as central to the achievement of National and Global Sustainable Development Goals. Optimum and appropriate nutrition is essential for women and children to survive, thrive and break the intergenerational cycle of poor health and poverty in the community. The underlying causes of malnutrition that results in undersized children and adults, are multifaceted and rooted in economic and social factors such as poverty, low levels of female literacy, lack of access to clean drinking water, sanitation and hygiene, maternal characteristics, inadequate curative and preventive health care, maternal, household and community resources and women empowerment. := Malnutrition is one of the most important challenges facing contemporary India.

The Ministry of Women and Child Development has rolled out Poshan Tracker application. The goal is to follow nutrition systems strengthening approach for improving maternal and child undernutrition, focused on strengthening implementation bottlenecks at all levels. The Poshan Tracker is built using centralized data architecture, that also aligns with the digital technology systems of other ministries and programs. The system provides a digital identity to each beneficiary through a digital card, and allows convergence of call centre with the technology platform. The system generates automated alerts to the critical last-mile beneficiaries. It also ensures efficient audit of the delivery system, by documenting real time attendance of beneficiaries and duty bearers. Such a robust digital technology platform and management information system, will help the mission to scale efficiently, thereby generating and documenting significant positive impact. := The Ministry of Women and Child Development has rolled out Poshan Tracker application.
